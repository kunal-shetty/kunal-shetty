## What Drives Me

What motivates me most is **problem-solving**.

I enjoy breaking down complex challenges, identifying clean and scalable solutions, and transforming raw ideas into **polished, production-ready systems**. Whether it’s architecting robust backends, debugging intricate issues, or integrating **AI / ML capabilities**, I approach every challenge as an opportunity to grow and innovate.

I care deeply about:
- Clean architecture and scalability  
- Performance and reliability  
- Thoughtful UI/UX and design thinking  
- Building software that *actually gets used*
